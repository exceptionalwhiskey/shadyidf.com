        <textarea>
Host Europe GmbH Abuse Department,

I’m reaching out to see if Host Europe GmbH plans to continue hosting alkasheffgaza.net (IP address: 92.205.13.44).

This illegal extortion website (including private information about children!) snuck in Host Europe GmbH's shared hosting on May 29th. The Israeli military previously tried to host this site at Webflow and Namecheap Hosting but was deplatformed once we alerted those companies.

Now the extortion website is trying to set up on their third hosting platform in two weeks - yours!

This has opened up Host Europe GmbH to significant potential liability given European Union privacy laws.

We encourage Host Europe GmbH to take immediately in order to protect their brand, uphold industry standards and avoid potential civil, and even criminal, liability.

Should Host Europe GmbH refuse to take action, the IP address hosting the IDF extortion site will be reported for abuse.

Find more information about the Israeli military extortion website  are hosting at https://x.com/receipts_lol/status/1793052036201587173.

Please take action promptly. This is of the utmost importance, as lives are at risk from the IDF website exploiting your platform to conduct extortion-at-scale!

Thank you,

[Your name]

        <h2>About the IDF Extortion Website</h2>

        <p>
            On May 17, the Israeli military
            <a href="https://x.com/ytirawi/status/1791451753910526420">dropped leaflets in Deir Balah, Gaza</a>
            for the purpose of extorting Gaza residents, <em>including children and toddlers</em>. The leaflets threaten to reveal Gazan's personal information; criminal records, extramarital affairs, LGBTQ identities, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The IDF leaflets, designed to look like a newspaper, use the name ‘The Exposer’. The IDF also developed a matching extortion website, <a href="https://mondoweiss.net/2024/05/israels-extortion-leaflets-and-namecheap-how-to-do-corporate-accountability-during-a-genocide/">complete with a snitch box, separate snitch Telegram and Twitter accounts, and a countdown timer</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Webflow and Namecheap hosting deplatformed the IDF extortion website when we alerted them</h2>
        <p>It is <strong>shameful</strong> that Host Europe GmbH continues to provide hosting services for the IDF extortion website.</p>

        <h2>Twitter locked the account on its social media platform</h2>
        <p> It is <strong>shameful</strong> that Telegram continues to allow the IDF extortion account to operate on its platform.</p>
